# incasa-sim/simulation

This (currently empty) folder will contains scripts implementing an Incasa operations simulation. 

One first step will be simulating demand. A potential output of a demand simulation could be a collection of timestamped lat-lon pairs corresponding to service requests arising within a given window of time (e.g., a 24 hour period).
