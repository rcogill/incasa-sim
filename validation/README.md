# incasa-sim/validation

This (currently empty) folder will contain scripts that validate models underlying the simulation against external data sources. 

One first step will be simulating and validating demand. For example, one protocol for validating demand against CVS MinuteClinic data could be the following:
* Start with a probabilistic demand model build from a given training set containing CVS MinuteClinic data.
* Assume each demand point generated by our model is mapped to the nearest MinuteClinic. This will yield an arrival process for each clinic.
* This arrival model will be evaluated out of sample and against several simple benchark arrival models (described below). 
* Assume each uptick in wait time at each clinic corresponds to an arrival. 
* Given a sequence of arrivals for a given clinic, evaluate the negative log-likelihood of the observed arrivals with respect to the arrival model.
* Evaluate the total neg. log-likelihood across all clinics and observed time periods. 
* This log-likelihood should be compared several simple benchmarks, such as separate independent Poisson processes with fixed rates for each clinic.
